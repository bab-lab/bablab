["lab-protocols.html", "Section 3 Lab Protocols 3.1 Meetings and Training 3.2 Mail 3.3 Purchasing 3.4 Software 3.5 Equipment 3.6 Social Media", " Section 3 Lab Protocols 3.1 Meetings and Training 3.1.1 Lab Meetings We are happy to have a range of students join us for weekly lab meeting, whether you are an official member of the lab, or are just visiting – we want a diversity of perspectives in the lab, so join in and make your voice heard. You might be wondering why we need a protocol for a lab meeting? The answer is simple – to make the meetings as time efficient, cohesive, and productive as possible. To achieve that goal, we follow a structured template for weekly lab meetings: 3.1.1.1 Meeting Blocks The first layer to the lab meeting structure is to have ‘Meeting Blocks’ which focus the content of our lab meetings for set periods of time (typically 3-5 weeks) on a particular topic. The topics of the Meeting Blocks are decided as a group and will be chosen for strategic purposes (e.g., if we are writing a grant or paper on a particular topic area we might assign a meeting block to that topic, likewise – if we are exploring measures for a new study, we could assign a meeting block to searching for a range of measures and deciding on the best available). You can find a list of potential Meeting Block topics at the end of this document. If there is a topic of high general interest to the lab, we can also schedule a meeting block on it (even if we don’t directly research that topic). At the end of each meeting block we will discuss the next block assignment as a group. If you have an idea for a meeting block, feel free to bring it up at the end of the current block (and add it to the list in this paper doc). 3.1.1.2 Syllabus Development The first step in a meeting block will be to develop a syllabus for the coming weeks. The syllabus can either be worked on as a group (e.g., in the first meeting of a new block), or one person can be in charge of developing the syllabus. Roles &amp; Responsibilities Select! a sub-topic or research question for each meeting within the block Select a set of readings/material (can be movie clips, podcasts etc.) to go through each week (keep in mind that people have limited time to review the material for lab meeting so assign one primary reading/material and place add additional materials into a supplement, in case people wish to review further) Make a document for the meeting and share it with all meeting attendees Make sure that people are signed up to lead each meeting in the block Be in charge of sending reminders for the meetings in the block Make any meeting notes at the end of each meeting, and make sure the paper doc is up to date at the close of the meeting Make a post on the BABLab twitter for each meeting so people know what we are talking and thinking about 3.1.1.3 Meeting Leaders Each meeting will be assigned a meeting leader. The leader is the person who has chosen or been assigned the primary reading or media material for that week. Roles and Responsibilities Read/watch/listen to the media assigned for that week in detail Think about themes that can be brought up in the lab meeting to discuss as a group Be ready to facilitate the meeting and stimulate conversation Keep the meeting on track (practice those assertive conversation steering techniques!) The meeting leader does NOT need to make slides, prepare food, or do anything else beyond the roles and responsibilities outlined above. 3.1.1.4 Meeting Attendee It is not always possible to read/watch/listen to the media for every lab meeting in detail. That is why we assign one person (the meeting leader) to do a deep dive into the material each week. While a deep dive is not necessary, all meeting attendees are expected to be familiar with the media and topic of conversation each week so that they may contribute meaningfully to discussions. Roles and Responsibilities Familiarize yourself with the media being presented that week. If you have time, do a deep dive too Be thoughtful in the lab meetings and try to make constructive comments If you come across additional material that you think would be good to include in the lab meeting supplement, add it into the paper doc (on dropbox) Try to connect the discussions in lab meeting with the past meetings in the current meeting block, as well as with discussions in past blocks 3.1.1.5 Potential Lab Meeting Block Topics (in no particular order) Sensitive periods in learning and memory Mind Brain Body Study: Questionnaires Role of the hippocampus in learning and memory across development Nutritional Psychiatry Nutrition and cognitive development How does early adversity or lifetime stress affect the microbiome? Bottom up: microbiome influences on brain and behavior Top down: brain and behavioral influences on microbiome Mind Brain Body Study: In lab task review Multivariate analytical techniques in fMRI Microbiome methods Electrogastrograph – what do we know about the signal? Heart Rate Variability and early life stress Integrating physiological measures to enrich our understanding of behavior Kind of crazy ideas, but wouldn’t it be cool if they worked session. Research group highlight - we pick a research group (or even a general research topic) and review the body of work they engage in, or in the case of the research topic, who the big research groups in the field are. 3.1.2 Trainee Tuesdays &amp; Thursdays In order to encourage “deep work” time, we are implementing Trainee Tuesdays and Thursdays! All trainings, meetings, questions/concerns that will take longer than 10 minutes (unless URGENT) should be scheduled on Tuesdays and Thursdays if possible. Please feel free to schedule a meeting if you’d like to discuss your research/work more deeply or learn a new skill. If you are simply having an issue with an assignment, before you schedule a meeting with a lab manager we ask that you try the following steps in this order: Check the OSF protocol - there might be step-by-step instructions for your issue in the BABLab OSF or study specific OSF protocols Watch a training video - if one exists for the issue/task at hand Consult a fellow RA - they may know what to do Consult a senior RA Make a list of notes in your RA notebook about the problems you are having and present them for discussion at Thursday’s RA meeting Finally, schedule a one-on-one meeting with Emily or Kristen To do so, please create an event on the BABLab calendar. Please create this event on the blue BABLab calendar using the template below during a time the lab manager is free. Invite yourself and the lab manager you’d like to meet with! Title: Meeting - “Meeting topic” Description: “Brief meeting description” Guests: Individuals invited to the meeting Example: [Calendar Template Example][3] I (Emily) have also shared my personal calendar with the BABLab account, so you can see when I am available to meet with you. You can access it by selecting “Emily Towner” from “Other calendars” in the BABLab calendar. The off-white “busy” slots are times I am unavailable (doctor’s appointments, non lab-related meetings etc.). [Emily’s Calendar][4] 3.1.3 Clinical Meetings Purpose The purpose of clinical meetings are to discuss and review ongoing clinical interviews (KSADs), troubleshoot any recent difficulties, and learn helpful interviewing tactics for future clinical interviews. During the meeting, you will present the team with background information from your clinical interview and walk through each supplement. What To Prepare Who you are presenting Participant’s KSADS file Date/time of session Brief background Was the child bio/adopted? Age of adoption Was there any prenatal exposure? Any trouble in school? Supplements Your thought process on why/why not you went through each supplements/diagnoses you have assigned Personal opinions What was the child participant like in the session? (note relevant behaviors for context) WASI/WIAT A quick overview of the participant’s WASI/WIAT (admission and scores) Questions for the team Any situations you feel may have been difficult to address during the clinical interview Additional notes These meetings are also a safe space to debrief potentially difficult interviews. 3.2 Mail 3.2.1 USPS When sending things out USPS, you can place your recharge ID under the sender’s address, circle it, &amp; drop it in the outgoing mail bin in 1282 (faculty mailroom) 3.3 Purchasing 3.3.1 Funds Startup: 4-404040-CB-69460 (Recharge ID: WSTV) R00: 4-444040-CB-31447 (Recharge ID: Y7XE) 3.3.2 PAC Orders PAC forms are used for most purchasing requests (besides Amazon which we can order from directly with our Amazon business account).

If you are purchasing an item flagged as restricted your fund manager may reach out to you for additional information. Restricted items are not necessarily unallowable, but may require additional levels of approval from the Pcard Administrator in Purchasing before we can charge it to a Pcard. Next, select the appropriate shipping address Next, you will select the method of payment. This should be a VISA with your fund manager’s name on the card. You do not have the option to edit this page and it is not necessary to include a reference number. Click continue. Review your order details and once confirmed, click on submit order for approval.

Pick up the passes with the confirmation code at 555 Westwood Plaza, Suite 100. 3.3.6 Petty Cash Fill out a blank IRB research payment request form (Dropbox/BAB/Lab/Lab_protocols/Finances/Petty_cash/) Send it to Brian Hoang (brianhoang@psych.ucla.edu) for a signature Submit the form at this [site][6] It can take up to 10 business days for them to reply back. When they recontact with a delivery time, ensure that either of the people who signed the form (Bridget and an RA) are in the lab at the time of delivery to sign off on the order. They will not deliver the cash if one of the signers is not present Once the disbursement is received, log it on the study specific payment log 3.3.7 Vendor specific protocols Some vendors have special requirements or instructions to make purchases from them. Biopac - Email aimeew@biopac.com and frontdesk@biopac.com Uprinting Go to Uprinting.com and log in. Select the items you want to purchase and add them to the cart. Note that you need to have the pdf or image files on-hand and make sure they match the dimensions of what they will be printed on When checking out, select “Terms” as the payment method Create and submit a PAC form to purchasing as usual, but also cc jhoan.e@digitalroominc.com and request that purchasing get in touch with her to pay for the order 3.3.8 Logging purchases on Trello Search up “Purchasing” board on Trello. It should be green.There are different tabs: To Return: items that will be returned Maybe: items that may be bought To Order: items to order/ buy Sumbitted: orders that have been submitted Placed: orders that have been placed In Stock: items that have arrived and are in lab Add a card to “To Order”. Name it with this format: item being bought - $price Add the following labels: Budget: Nonlogged (this is by default) Fund (ask lab manager whether it’s Startup or R00) Category (ask lab manager which category) Add the link of the item on ‘add an attachment’. Rename the link the exact name of the item as written on Amazon (or whatever website). Add a description with this format: Units: (insert amount of item, ex. 20 pencils) Orders: (insert how many orders placed, ex. 1 order of 20 pencils) Date submitted: (insert date we submitted order) Date placed: (insert date vendor has placed order) Date received: (insert date we got it in lab) If the card is something that may run out eventually (ex. granola bars, notebooks) add an approximate due date. Whenever an item has been submitted, placed, and in stock, move the card into its respective tab. @youtube 3.4 Software 3.4.1 Using Trello There are multiple lists on the Tasks Board! Doing, To-do, Later and Done. Depending on the task, simply move it to the right list once you progress with it. To Do: Current tasks to complete. Doing: Tasks currently being done. Later: Tasks not as pressing, but still must be done. Done: Completed tasks. To add a card: Click ‘+ Add Another Card’ under the appropriate list. There are multiple functions within this: You can add members, labels (useful for studies), checklist, attachment, due date and more to the back of the card. This information will show when you click on the card. Show Menu function: This is a great way to search specific items, such as your own name for tasks, or the study for which there are tasks for, or tasks which have upcoming due dates. @youtube 3.4.2 REDCap 3.4.2.1 Entering Instruments @youtube 3.5 Equipment 3.5.1 Biopac 3.5.2 Printer Make sure you are connected to eduroam wifi Open up Printer &amp; Scanners in System Preferences If current printer is not working, right click printer and click Reset Printing System Reset Computer Open up System Preferences – Printers &amp; Scanners Click on + sign to add a printer Enter IP Address from Printer: 164.67.125.35 Make sure Use displays: EPSON WF-7710 Series Click ADD Reset your Printer Presets if needed 3.6 Social Media 3.6.1 Instagram The pride and joy of the lab. There is a lot of content to keep track of and to ensure is posted weekly. General important rules: - Keep posts short, family-friendly, and accessible. - If you post on the story, it should also likely be added to a story highlight. - Stick to the color scheme and aesthetic (this includes matching the text in story highlights to the story highlight cover color). - Maintain the integrity of the main feed grid (will be elaborated on further down). - Maintain the consistency of the Lab’s hashtags (will be elaborated on further down). Feed Content: - The feed grid is an important part of the aesthetic of the lab’s social media. We can divide the grid into “A Week” and “B Week” rows. Because there are 3 posts horizontally in the grid, there should be 3 pieces of content posted each week (or with relative consistency). “A Week”: - Biome Bites! ad post: This is simply a post saying to check the story for this week’s Biome Bites! installment. The caption for this should be brief and maybe reference the content in the actual story post. - Lab Meeting ad post OR Email List ad post: Post this on lab meeting day in “A Week”. If there is a speaker or specific topic for the week, discuss that briefly in the caption. - In “B Week”, don’t post this even if there is a lab meeting. Instead, post a previous Lab Meeting ad post on the story. If there is not a lab meeting during that “A Week”, you should post the Email List ad post instead. - Brain Bites! ad post: This is simply a post saying to check the story for this week’s Brain Bites! installment. The caption for this should be brief and maybe reference the content in the actual story post. “B Week”: - 3 random posts: post pictures from around the lab, from events, or advertisements for upcoming events. Check the existing feed for ideas, and try to stay current with seasons, trends, etc. - If there is an event upcoming, use the following template to advertise it. Important notes for all feed content: - Post all posts to both instagram and facebook (integrated feature on insta) - End every single post with the following: #brain - Add 2-3 topical hashtags on the new line afterwards, and then follow that with the following block of hashtags: #funscience #psychology #neuroscience #research #lablife #ucla #gutbiome #dev #psych #brain #body #adolescence #childhood #ela #losangeles #scientist Story Content: - Q&amp;A Monday: every Monday, post the Q&amp;A Monday story with instagram’s questions feature attached. Check periodically throughout the day to see if there are any questions worth responding to. Post any responses on the Q&amp;A story highlight. - Biome Bites!: A weekly fun fact about the microbiome. Try to stay scientific (with citations) and avoid product/treatment recommendations that might be trendy or controversial. Post the bite itself on the story, and every other week advertise it with a main feed post. Add to the Weekly Bites story highlight. - Lab Meeting ad: on lab meeting days, post one of the ad posts on the story. - Brain Bites!: A weekly fun fact about the brain/developmental psych. Try to stay scientific (with citations) and avoid product/treatment recommendations that might be trendy or controversial. Post the bite itself on the story, and every other week advertise it with a main feed post. Add to the Weekly Bites story highlight. - Contact Story ad: on Fridays, post the contact story post. When events are coming up, be sure to post frequently on the story about the date, time, and what activities we will be doing. There is a whole series of story templates made to show off different activities and share information regarding the event. Where to Find the Designs: - All of the above designs for social media posts are on our canva site. - If you need to adjust any of the designs, feel free to do so. - Pre-downloaded versions are also saved as images and pdfs on dropbox. 3.6.2 Facebook Most of the content will carry over from instagram because the accounts are linked. Just ensure that you stay active with checking notifications and responding to comments. Consistency across all of the lab materials is the most important thing to maintain for our online footprint. If you are unsure of what a post should look like, check out previous posts and highlights for ideas! "],
