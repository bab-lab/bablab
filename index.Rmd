# Introduction

----------


<h1>Welcome to the BABLab Wiki!</h1>

In the <b>Brain and Body Lab</b> we are interested in how early experiences influence interactions between the brain and body, contributing to mental and physical health. We hope to use this information to improve the wellbeing of children, adolescents, and adults across the world. In other words, in the BABLab, we aim to do good science that makes a difference to peopleâ€™s lives, today and tomorrow.

The BABLab is directed by Dr. Bridget Callaghan, Assistant Professor of Psychology at UCLA.

**Current Projects:**

 - [Mind, Brain, Body (MBB)](https://bab-lab.github.io/mind_brain_body/)
 - [EGG and Emotionality (EGG)](https://osf.io/nf2bv/)
 - Transfer Mental Health
