### Offboarding Tasks - Volunteer Research Assistant 

1. Ensure all tasks on Trello have been reassigned to another active member of the lab, or completed prior to departure.
2. Any departing Research Assistant should train another active member of the lab on any processes/tasks they have been in charge of (if nobody else in the lab carries this knowledge).
3. Lab manager should remove this member from all necessary Lab applications (Slack, Box, Trello, Shared Google Calendar, etc.).
4. Lab manager to update the Lab website.
5. Social Media Manager to update status to Lab alumni.
6. Submit PAF form with updated end date to HR for all volunteers (see specific instructions below)

### PAF 
 
NOTE: This action should only be taken if the volunteer has paperwork within HR (a non-UCLA student volunteer)

1. If the Volunteer Research Assistant is leaving prior to their previously specified end date, lab manager must submit a PAF form to HR.
    - If the previously specified end date is not known, email HR to confirm
2. Request a Personnel Action Form (PAF) from HR (Michelle Claudio, mclaudio@psych.ucla.edu).
3. Fill out the Personnel Action Form (PAF) with effective date, new official end date, and Bridget's signature. 
    - Note: fund manager signature is not needed, as volunteer positions do not require funding
4. Once submitted, HR will update the Volunteer Research Assistant's UCPath. 
5. Save the PAF to Box (BabLab>Lab>Documents>RA_hiring_documents>RA_offboarding_PAF)
